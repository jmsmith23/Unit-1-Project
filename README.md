# JEOPARDY!

JEOPARDY! is a two player turn based trivia game. Each player selects a clue from one of the five catagories. If the player answers the clue correctly, they earn the dollar (point) amount and pick another clue. If the player answers incorrectly, the clue value is deducted from their score and control is turned over to the other player. The second player has the chance to answer the same question. If they answer right, they earn the points and select the next clue etc. The game ends when the board is cleared and the player with the most money (points) wins. JEOPARDY! is a popular american game show that has aired for over 40 years. This version is based off of the tv show, with slight variations to the rules but captures the essence of the game.
